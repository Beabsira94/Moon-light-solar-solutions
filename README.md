## Overview 
The purpose of this project is to assist MoonLight Energy Solutions in realizing their objective of increasing sustainability and energy efficiency through wise solar panel investments. As a team, our job is to analyze vital environmental data, such temperature, humidity, and solar radiation, to determine the best places to put solar panels. Our goal in looking through these data points is to find trends and information that will guide the company's long-term investment choices.


We will use the results of this study to provide a data-driven report that illustrates how these decisions fit with MoonLight's dedication to energy conservation and environmental protection, in addition to highlighting the ideal locations for solar installation. Our efforts will have a direct influence on the company's sustainability goals by assisting them in making decisions that balance their business objectives with their environmental impact.
