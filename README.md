Comparison of Solar Panel Installation in Togo, Sierra Leone, and Benin
Project Synopsis
The goal of this study is to determine the best places to install solar panels in Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo, three West African nations. Through the examination of significant meteorological information, such as solar irradiance, temperature, humidity, wind patterns, and precipitation, we determine which nation presents the most favorable circumstances for the generation of solar energy. In order to improve solar panel performance, the experiment also highlights how crucial routine maintenance and sensor cleaning are.
Features
Using Streamlit, an interactive dashboard was created that lets users examine solar data for the three nations. Trends can be dynamically analyzed thanks to filters for daily, monthly, and quarterly data views.
Visualizations: With a color scheme that matches a navy-blue background, the dashboard contains line graphs showing trends in Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI), Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI), Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DHI), and ambient temperature.
Comparing countries: Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo's solar potential can be compared, along with a thorough analysis of the environmental elements that affect solar panel efficiency.

In summary
The relevance of climate, environmental factors, and the unpredictable nature of solar resources are highlighted in the project's conclusion as they relate to choosing the optimum sites for solar panel installations in Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo. After careful analysis, Benin stands out as the most promising candidate because of its high solar radiation levels, comfortable temperatures, and controllable humidity levels. These parameters establish a setting that optimizes solar energy generation while guaranteeing effective panel operation and system upkeep.
The long-term viability of solar energy systems in Benin depends on routine maintenance and monitoring, especially to reduce the impacts of wind and humidity. Benin's solar energy potential is well-positioned for success with its optimized cleaning cycles and durability against unpredictable environmental circumstances.

Upcoming Projects
Analyzing the effects of seasonal fluctuations on solar energy output and broadening the dataset to cover more locations within the countries are two areas of potential future research. Incorporating machine learning models into the dashboard to improve its predictive skills can also result in more accurate suggestions for solar panel installations.
